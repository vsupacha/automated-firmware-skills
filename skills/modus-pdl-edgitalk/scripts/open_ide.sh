# Stage 2d: hand an app over to the IDE - VS Code + Infineon ModusToolbox for VS Code - so the
# developer can edit, build, program and debug it with the extension's own tasks and launch
# configurations. Runs ModusToolbox's own `make vscode` (once, or again with --refresh), which
# writes .vscode/ and <app>.code-workspace for all projects of the app (proj_cm33_s,
# proj_cm33_ns, proj_cm55), applies the extension's own task/settings fix (vscode_fix.py), then
# opens that workspace - never the app folder itself.
# new_app.sh runs this after creating the app (--no-open there: no window).
# Usage: open_ide.sh <app-dir> [--no-open] [--refresh]
#   --refresh   re-run make vscode (after a BSP/library change, another PC or another ModusToolbox)
# Gate: "IDE: READY <workspace>" (+ "IDE: OPENED"). Exit 10 ACTION: SETUP = VS Code or the
# extension is missing (installing them is the developer's).
#
# The IDE works on the same project and outputs as the scripts: the same Makefiles, mtb_shared
# and build/ folders as build.sh; "Build"/"Program" tasks = make build / make program (KitProg3 +
# OpenOCD, without the skill's identity gate). The generated files hold this PC's tool paths:
# they are git-ignored and re-made per PC.
